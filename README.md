# Exoplanets Classification

This project experiments various models to classify the Exoplanets candidates found by the NASA space probe Kepler.
This dataset is taken from the [CalTech site](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/).

The models used in this project are:
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree
- SVM
- KNN
- Random Forest
- Gradient Tree Boosting

all of them taken from the [Scikit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) python package.
